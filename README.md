iOS ANZDemo App of UserList
A modern iOS application built with SwiftUI that displays a list of users and their detailed information, following Clean Architecture principles and SOLID design patterns.
üì± Features

User List Screen: Displays a scrollable list of users with pull-to-refresh functionality
User Detail Screen: Shows comprehensive user information including contact details, address, and company information
Error Handling: Robust error handling with user-friendly error messages and retry functionality
Loading States: Visual feedback during network operations
Navigation: Smooth navigation between list and detail screens

üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The app follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:
Layers

Presentation Layer (Views/, ViewModels/)

SwiftUI views for UI presentation
ViewModels for business logic and state management
Follows MVVM pattern


Domain Layer (Models/)

Core business entities (User model)
Pure Swift objects with no external dependencies


Data Layer (Services/, Core/)

Network service for API communication
Repository pattern implementation
Data transformation and caching


Infrastructure Layer (Core/)

Dependency injection container
Network utilities and error handling



SOLID Principles Implementation

Single Responsibility: Each class has one clear responsibility
Open/Closed: Protocol-based design allows for easy extension
Liskov Substitution: Mock implementations can replace real services
Interface Segregation: Focused protocols for specific functionalities
Dependency Inversion: High-level modules depend on abstractions

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Swift 5.7+
SwiftUI: Modern declarative UI framework
Combine: Reactive programming framework
async/await: Modern concurrency for asynchronous operations
URLSession: Native networking
XCTest: Unit testing framework
Dependency Injection: Manual DI container implementation

üîß Key Features Implementation
Modular Architecture

Protocol-based design for easy testing and flexibility
Dependency injection for loose coupling
Separation of concerns across different layers

Async/Await & Combine

Dual implementation: Both async/await and Combine patterns
Modern concurrency for better performance
Cancellation support for request management

Error Handling

Comprehensive error types with user-friendly messages
Retry mechanisms for failed requests
Loading and error states in UI

Testing

Unit tests for ViewModels and Services
Mock implementations for isolation
Async testing support

üß™ Testing Strategy
The app includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

Service Layer: Network service and user service tests
ViewModels: Business logic and state management tests
Mock Objects: Complete mock implementations for testing
Async Testing: Proper async/await testing patterns
